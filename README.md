# JGroups Netty

**DISCLAIMER**: This project is still experimental and has not been thoroughly tested.

This project uses the Netty framework as the transport layer for JGroups. This is developed by Masterâ€™s students from Newcastle University as part of their final project under the supervision of Bela Ban. 

Mailing list for questions/issues/comments: [1]

## Usage
The JGroups protocol configuration using Netty can be found in `netty.xml`. The `XML` file can then be used as the `-props` field in JGroups.
By default `use_native_transport` is set to `false` however setting it to `true` will require a Unix system to work. If the native system is used then then the required tools and libraries must be installed. Instruction for that can be found [here.](https://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html#building-the-linux-native-transport)

Taken from Netty 
```
To build the native transport, you need to use Linux with 64-bit kernel 2.6 or higher. Please also install the required tools and libraries:

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
sudo yum install autoconf automake libtool make tar \
                 glibc-devel libaio-devel \
                 libgcc.i686 glibc-devel.i686
# Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool make tar \
                     gcc-multilib libaio-dev
Building the MacOS/BSD native transport
To build the native transport, you need to use MacOS 10.12 or higher. Please also install the required tools and libraries:

brew install autoconf automake libtool
```
### Build and Run
Running `./build.sh` will do a maven clean install and copy the dependencies.
`run.sh` will include the dependencies as part of the java classpath argument and can be used to run JGroups.
#### Example 
```
./build.sh
./run.sh org.jgroups.tests.perf.UPerf -props netty.xml
```
## Implementation Details
The JGroups protocol is implemented in `Netty.java` which will manage `TCP` communication to other peers. To understand how this transport layer works, only 2 classes needs to be understood `Netty.java` and `NettyConnection.java`

### `Netty.java`
This class is an extension of `TP` and provides all the details in order for the JGroups stack to integrate with Netty. `Netty.java` will create a `NettyConnection` by passing an instance of `NettyReceiverListener` which has callbacks for `onReceive` and `onError`. These methods are fired when a message is received or when an error has been thrown by Netty.

### `NettyConnection.java`
One of the limitations with Netty is the use of the client-server model. This creates a challenge where a P2P model is required. So each `NettyConnection` will have instances of both server and a client. The client will initiate requests and the server will receive incoming requests. To avoid a `N * (N-1)` connections, we implement a lookup table that checks to see if a connection is already made to a well known address and reuse the channel if there is a connection established.

Each instance of `NettyConnection` will have a well known address in the format `bind_addr:port`. These addresses are the same as those specified in `TCPPING`. Each message sent by `NettyConnection` will include the well-known address and will be stored in the receivers and senders look up table. This will create a mapping in the format `well-known address -> channel`.

## Preliminary Results
Netty seems to increase performance by 14% with a lower thread count and an exponentially increasing payload size but with a higher thread count and increasing cluster size, Netty seems to perform worse. Interestingly in both tests, at 23 nodes, the expected trend does not follow as there is only a small margin of performance increase in the first test and an 11% decrease in performance in the second test. More performnace testsing are on the way.

The following versions were used to measure the throughput of both TCP and Netty.
-   VM: 						Google Cloud N2 machine (General Purpose)
-   OS: 						Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
-   Netty Version: 		4.1.50.Final
-   JGroups Version: 	5.0.0.Beta1
-   Project build:			 v0.0.1-perf-test
    
This test was run with a maximum of 200 and 500 thread per node and repeated 3 times. Unfortunately due to the huge amount of resources required at 45 nodes and 500 threads, the 1MB payload test did not work and so the results are omitted from the graphs and table.

### Table of Results
The following tables show the performance difference between TCP and Netty. To calculate the differences the formula shown below was used. The average throughput for each payload and all clusters are shown
below.

```
Difference = ((TCP Throughput - Netty Throughput)/TCP Throughput) * 100
```
